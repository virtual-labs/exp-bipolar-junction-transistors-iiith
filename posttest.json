        "b": "The base is heavily doped and thick",
        "c": "The collector is moderately doped and larger in size",
        "d": "The base and collector have identical doping levels"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The emitter is heavily doped for strong carrier injection.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The base is lightly doped and thin to allow carriers to pass easily.",
        "c": "Correct. The collector is moderately doped and physically larger to handle heat dissipation and higher currents.",

        "a": "Incorrect. The base current is typically the smallest.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Collector current is large but slightly less than emitter current.",
        "c": "Correct. The emitter supplies almost all carriers, making I_E slightly larger than I_C.",

        "d": "Thermal voltage"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Emitter injection efficiency γ measures how effectively carriers are injected into the base.",
        "b": "Incorrect. V_A relates to the Early effect, not injection.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Base transport factor measures carrier recombination, not injection strength.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In forward-active mode, VEB must be forward-biased and VCB reverse-biased, regardless of PNP or NPN type.",
        "b": "Incorrect. That would correspond to cutoff mode.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That describes reverse-active mode.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Check the formula I_C = β × I_B.",
        "b": "Correct. I_C = 150 × 40 μA = 6.0 mA.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That assumes a wrong β value.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That would require I_B = 80 μA."

        "d": "Maximum possible"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In cutoff, I_B ≈ 0, so IC ≈ 0.",
        "b": "Correct. In cutoff mode, both junctions are reverse-biased, and IC is negligible.",
        "c": "Incorrect. IC ≈ IE only in active and saturation modes.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Maximum current occurs in saturation, not cutoff."

        "d": "IC abruptly drops to zero at high V<sub>CE</sub>"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. IC does not decrease with VCE in active mode.",
        "b": "Incorrect. IC slightly changes even in active mode due to Early effect.",
        "c": "Correct. Higher VCE narrows the base width, increasing IC slightly.",
        "d": "Incorrect. BJTs don’t abruptly cut off under normal operation."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Check the Early effect formula.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Without Early effect, IC = β × IB = 10 mA, but we must adjust for VCE.",
        "c": "Correct. IC ≈ β × IB × (1 + VCE / VA) = 10 mA × (1 + 10/80) ≈ 11.25 mA ≈ 11.0 mA.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Emitter crowding is unrelated to base doping.",
