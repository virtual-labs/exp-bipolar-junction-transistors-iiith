      "question": "1. In a BJT, which terminals control the flow of current between the other two terminals?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Emitter controls collector and base",
        "b": "Base controls current between collector and emitter",
        "c": "Collector controls emitter current",
        "d": "All three equally control current"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The emitter provides carriers but does not control the current.",
        "b": "Correct. In a BJT, the base terminal modulates the current between the collector and emitter.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The collector just collects carriers; it does not control current flow.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The base has the dominant control role."

        "c": "The emitter is lightly doped to allow easy carrier diffusion.",
        "d": "Base-collector junction is always forward-biased."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Collector doping depends on the device type.",
        "b": "Correct. The base is thin and lightly doped to allow efficient carrier injection.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The emitter is heavily doped for strong carrier injection.",

        "d": "300 - 2000"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is too low for most BJTs.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Some power BJTs may have β in this range but not small-signal ones.",
        "c": "Correct. Small-signal BJTs typically have β values between 20 and 300.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. That represents the cutoff region.",
        "b": "Correct. Forward-active mode requires VBE forward-biased and VBC reverse-biased for amplification.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both junctions forward-biased indicate saturation mode.",
        "d": "Incorrect. That corresponds to reverse-active mode."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Check the formula I_C = β × I_B.",
        "b": "Correct. I_C = β × I_B = 100 × 20 μA = 2.0 mA.",
        "c": "Incorrect. That's too high; it assumes incorrect scaling.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Double-check the calculation."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The Early effect is unrelated to temperature.",
        "b": "Correct. The Early effect refers to base-width modulation when VCE increases, increasing IC.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Collector current actually increases with VCE in active mode.",
        "d": "Incorrect. There is no complete cutoff in active mode."
