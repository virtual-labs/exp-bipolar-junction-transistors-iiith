## Procedure

⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.

### Task-1: BJT Device Structure and Operating Region Identification

In the first task, the user is presented with the BJT device structure visualization showing the three regions: emitter, base, and collector. The simulation displays:
- Device cross-section with clearly marked N-P-N or P-N-P junction structure
- Two different bias configurations labeled "forward-active" and "saturation"
- Energy band diagrams corresponding to each operating mode
- Current flow animations with electron and hole movements

The user must identify and label each visualization with their respective operating regions and explain the carrier transport mechanisms in each mode.

### Task-2: Interactive I-V Characteristics and Parameter Effects

In the second task, there are interactive plots showing BJT characteristics where users can observe how different parameters affect transistor behavior:
- **Base Current Control**: Adjust IB from 0 to 100μA to see collector current variations
- **Collector-Emitter Voltage**: Vary VCE from 0 to 10V to study output characteristics
- **Base-Emitter Voltage**: Modify VBE to observe input characteristics and threshold behavior
- **Temperature Effects**: Change temperature from 250K to 400K to study thermal dependencies

Real-time characteristic curve updates allow users to understand the relationship between input and output parameters, current gain (β), and operating regions.

### Task-3: BJT Operating Modes and Switching Analysis

In the third task, users explore different BJT operating modes through:
- **Cutoff Region**: Apply reverse bias conditions and observe minimal collector current
- **Active Region**: Forward bias base-emitter junction and observe linear amplification
- **Saturation Region**: High base current conditions showing collector current limiting
- **Reverse Active**: Reverse the normal biasing to study unconventional operation

Interactive controls allow real-time switching between operating modes with visual feedback showing current flow animations and carrier distributions.

### Task-4: BJT Amplifier Configuration and Waveform Analysis

In the fourth task, the simulation demonstrates BJT amplifier operation with:
- **Common Emitter Configuration**: Input and output waveform analysis with phase inversion
- **Signal Amplification**: Apply sinusoidal input signals and observe amplified output
- **Gain Calculation**: Measure voltage gain, current gain, and power gain
- **Frequency Response**: Study amplifier bandwidth and frequency limitations

Users can adjust input signal amplitude, frequency, and bias points to optimize amplifier performance and understand gain-bandwidth trade-offs.
